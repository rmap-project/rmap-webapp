<h1>Welcome to the RMap Project!</h1>

<p>RMap Project is an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation-funded initiative undertaken by the Data Conservancy, Portico, and IEEE. 
The goal of RMap is to make it possible to preserve the many-to-many complex relationships among scholarly publications 
and their underlying data, thereby supporting the continual development of scholarly communication and digital publishing. 
Active work on RMap project began in April 2014.</p>
